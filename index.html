          “Best credit card” lists can look simple on the surface — but behind them are dozens of data points,
          weightings and assumptions. This page explains how rankings work so you can read them critically and match
          the structure to your own needs.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Card Ranking?</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card ranking is an ordered list of cards based on a specific scoring model. It can be as simple as
        “cheapest annual fee” or as complex as a multi-factor score that blends
        foreign-exchange fees, lounge access, insurance, rewards, technology, and support.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important part is that <strong>every ranking is built on a set of assumptions</strong>:
        which features matter, how they are measured, and how heavily they are weighted. Two ranking systems can
        look at the same cards and still produce different “top” results, simply because they treat factors differently.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Factors -->
    <section id="factors" class="section">
      <h2>Core Factors That Often Go Into Rankings</h2>
      <p>
        Serious card rankings usually consider more than just headline rewards. Common input factors include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-100/90">
        <li><strong>Foreign-exchange fees</strong> – % surcharge on non-local currency purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual fee</strong> – including companion cards and mandatory add-ons.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards structure</strong> – earn rates, caps, categories and devaluations.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel benefits</strong> – lounges, insurance, hotel/airline perks.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong> – virtual cards, tap-to-pay, wallets, security controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility &amp; credit profile</strong> – who the product is realistically designed for.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – how clearly fees and limitations are documented.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A ranking model combines these into a single score, but that score is only meaningful if
        you understand the underlying factors and whether they match your priorities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Methodology -->
    <section id="methodology" class="section">
      <h2>Ranking Methodology – What to Look For</h2>
      <p>
        When you see a “top 10” list, look for a clear methodology. A transparent ranking should tell you:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-100/90">
        <li><strong>Data sources</strong> – issuer documentation, regulatory filings, or marketing pages only.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification dates</strong> – when fees, perks and terms were last checked.</li>
        <li><strong>Weighting</strong> – e.g. FX fees 30%, lounges 20%, insurance 20%, rewards 20%, technology 10%.</li>
        <li><strong>Target user</strong> – frequent traveller, student, premium user, rebuild profile, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliate impact</strong> – whether sponsorship can influence inclusion or ordering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a ranking does not disclose its methodology, treat it as marketing rather than a neutral comparison. Always
        cross-check with official issuer documentation before applying for any card.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Comparison angle -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why “Best Card” Is Different for Everyone</h2>
      <p>
        A card that ranks #1 in a general list might be a poor match for you personally. Rankings are usually built
        for a <strong>model user</strong> – for example, a frequent flyer with a certain spend level and travel pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your situation might differ on key dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-100/90">
        <li>How often you travel, and to which regions.</li>
        <li>Whether you already have airline or hotel loyalty status.</li>
        <li>How sensitive you are to FX fees vs. lounges vs. rewards.</li>
        <li>Whether you usually pay in full or carry a balance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use rankings as <strong>structured input</strong>, not as a final verdict. The goal is to shortcut research,
        not to outsource all judgment.
