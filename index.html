          “Top 10” and “best card” lists are everywhere, but the underlying ranking logic is rarely explained. This page shows how neutral card rankings can be built from documentation and metrics — without telling anyone what they personally should choose.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to Rank Credit Cards?</h2>
      <p>Ranking credit cards means placing them in an ordered list based on one or more criteria: for example rewards density, pricing, protections or technology features. A transparent ranking shows which metrics were used and how they were combined.</p>
      <p>Neutral ranking is different from personal recommendations. It describes how a set of cards scores on defined metrics. It does not claim that the top-ranked card is “best” for everyone or that anyone will be approved for a specific product.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>From Metrics to Scores to Rankings</h2>
      <p>Most ranking systems follow a simple sequence, even if they do not state it explicitly:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Define the scope</strong> – choose which cards belong in the list (for example travel rewards or cashback products).</li>
        <li><strong>2. Select metrics</strong> – reward earn rates, annual fees, APR bands, protections, technology support and more.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Normalize data</strong> – express inputs in comparable units (for example per-unit-of-spend rewards, yearly fee cost).</li>
        <li><strong>4. Assign weights</strong> – decide how much each metric influences the overall score.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Calculate scores &amp; order</strong> – combine metrics into a score and sort cards from high to low.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The more clearly each step is documented, the easier it is for readers to interpret the final ranking as structured information rather than advice.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Choosing Metrics for Rewards &amp; Points</h2>
      <p>In rewards-focused contexts, ranking logic often revolves around how efficiently cards generate points, miles or cashback, before considering costs and risk. Common metrics include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Base earn rate</strong> – points, miles or cashback per unit of general spend.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus categories</strong> – higher earn rates on travel, groceries, fuel or online spend.</li>
        <li><strong>Caps and thresholds</strong> – where earn rates change or drop after a certain volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Redemption flexibility</strong> – options to use points for travel, statement credits or transfers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A neutral rewards ranking explains both the upside (earn potential) and the structural trade-offs (caps, complexity and devaluation risk).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limitations and Biases in Rankings</h2>
      <p>All rankings have limitations. They depend on data sources, assumptions and the metrics chosen. Neutral documentation acknowledges that:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>No single list can capture every individual use-case.</li>
        <li>Some metrics are hard to quantify, such as customer service quality.</li>
        <li>Terms change over time, so rankings represent a snapshot, not a permanent state.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is why rankings should be treated as structured summaries of documentation — not as personalized guidance or guarantees of future value.</p>
